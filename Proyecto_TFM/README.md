# Project Overview

## Introduction
The current project focuses on detecting live bee drone sperm using YOLO v8 library in processed videos. Live spermatozoa are identifiable by their circular shape, while dead ones tend to be elongated. The project leverages the CASABee - Master project, developed by my thesis advisor, Jose Divas√≥n Mallagaray, as a foundation for obtaining YOLO-formatted video labels and subsequent model training.

## Current Progress
We are currently in the initial phase of the project, which involves annotating images and correcting annotations. The video processing code can be found in the [ImageTagging](ImageTagging) folder within the repository.

## Next Steps
1. Refinement of annotation process.
2. Implementation of YOLO v8 for sperm detection.
3. Training and optimization of the detection model.


## Conclusion
The project aims to contribute to the field of bee reproductive biology by providing a reliable tool for drone sperm analysis, facilitating research in this crucial area.
