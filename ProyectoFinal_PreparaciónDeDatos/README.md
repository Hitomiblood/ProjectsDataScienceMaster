# PreparacionDeDatos-TrabajoFinal

This project encompasses information and a workflow for the Data Preparation final project as part of the Master's program in Data Science and Machine Learning. It involves the application of various techniques to clean and enhance information in our dataset, along with initial steps for creating machine learning models.

I collaborated on this project with my esteemed partner, [Nicolas Maldonado](https://github.com/nlmaldonadog).

We utilized the [National Health Insurance Corporation_Health checkup information](https://www.data.go.kr/data/15007122/fileData.do) dataset, employing various techniques for both categorical and numerical data.

Our exploration involved testing our approach with different simple models to observe how data processing impacts the results.
