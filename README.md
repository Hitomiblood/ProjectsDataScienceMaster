# Master Works in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

In this repository you will find all the most relevant works done in the Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of La Rioja in Spain. Within it you will see different related topics such as:

- Clustering application.
- Verification of clustering quality using internal and external metrics.
- Data preprocessing with multiple techniques comparison.
- Training of classification and regression models.
- Model improvement by hyperparameter tuning.
- Model verification with the use of various metrics.
- Interpretation of the obtained results.
