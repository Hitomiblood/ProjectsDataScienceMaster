# Master Works in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the most relevant works completed during the Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of La Rioja in Spain. It covers various topics, including:

- Clustering applications.
- Verification of clustering quality using internal and external metrics.
- Data preprocessing with a comparison of multiple techniques.
- Training of classification and regression models.
- Model improvement through hyperparameter tuning.
- Model verification using various metrics.
- Interpretation of the obtained results.

**Index:**
- **[ProyectoFinal_TecnicasCienciaDatos:](ProyectoFinal_TecnicasCienciaDatos)** A project focused on the entire process of generating a machine learning model, from data discovery and preparation to model training and the application of metrics to measure its efficiency.
- **[ProyectoFinal_AprendizajeAutomatico_I:](ProyectoFinal_AprendizajeAutomatico_I)** This project explores the [Obesity or CVD risk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster) dataset from Kaggle. We're examining various clustering techniques and determining the most effective one using both internal and external indices.
- **[ProyectoFinal_Preparaci칩nDeDatos:](ProyectoFinal_Preparaci칩nDeDatos)** This project was created to apply and assess various techniques and concepts for data processing, as learned in the Data Preprocessing class. We employed different models to compare the results and also utilized the dataset [National Health Insurance Corporation_Health checkup information](https://www.data.go.kr/data/15007122/fileData.do). The dataset contains a mix of numeric and categorical features.
